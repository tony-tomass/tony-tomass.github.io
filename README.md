# My Portfolio Website

Originally made to showcase my art portfolio developed during my Spring 2023 Web Design class, this website is used now to showcase and archive most if not all of my works - whether it be professional, as a hobby, or just for fun - in one simple to manage and easy-to-access place. The goal is to frequently update this repo, and by extension the website, with previews and links to each kind of project that I have developed or worked on, but I don't intent to do big updates or revamps to the website itself as frequently. While GitHub basically already does most of the things this website aims to achieve, the website will be able to present everything in a more visually appealing and cohesive way that would've been more difficult to accomplish by just using GitHub alone.

The original version of this website, as well as any other major versions that were made prior to the latest can also be found on the website.
